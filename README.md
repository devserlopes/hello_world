# hello_world
It's my first repository. It's where I'll register my first steps in IT area and take notes some ideas...


I would like begin with my first lesson here and contribution!...

# Here are some tips (for beginners) that can help you write a good README:

1- Start with an introduction: explain what the project is and what it is for.

2- Describe the features of the project: describe the main features of the project and what is possible to do with it.

3- Include installation instructions: If the project needs to be installed or configured in any way, include step-by-step instructions to help users do this.

4- Document the usage process: describe how the project can be used, step by step. If possible, include images or videos to help users visualize the process.
	
5- Provide code examples: If the project includes code examples, please provide them and explain how to use them.
	
6- Provide information on how to contribute: If you want others to contribute to the project, please include information on how to do so, how to clone the repository, and how to submit pull requests.
	
7- Include license information: If the project is under a specific license, please include information about that.
